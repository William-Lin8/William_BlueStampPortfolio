# Mini Tank Robot
The mini tank robot is a straightfoward build as its build is very comprehensible and easy to follow. While the components that make up the parts of the tank are not difficult to create, it is hard to ensure that all aspects of the tank are put together correctly so that the tank is able to move. While the code that allows the tank to move is prewritten, one could alternatively write their own code or modify the tank with a variety of different adjustments such as ones regarding the LED, bluetooth control, and the sensor.

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE



# Second Milestone

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

My first milestone includes the building process and the process of trying to get the tank to move. As of the first milestone, the tank is following a prewritten program that makes it move foward then backwards, and turns 180 in both direction. The code was uploaded from the Arduino IDE program onto the development board that is attached to the tank. The tank is powered by five 1.5 volts batteries. They are connected to the motor shield which sits on top of the development board. The wiring for the motors are also connected to the motor shield and this allows them to turn the wheels to get the tank to move and turn.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
